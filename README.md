## Project Outline
This project showcases our skills in HTML, Javascript & SQl. The team chose to explore movie success factors using the IMDb Top 1000 dataset due to the topic's broad appeal, real-world application in the film industry, and the dataset's richness. The intersection of data science, film studies, and business strategy, along with the opportunity for interdisciplinary learning and the practical application of technical skills using Flask and HTML, further motivated the selection of this engaging and multifaceted project.
